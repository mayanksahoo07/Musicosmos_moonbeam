							<p>
								Musicosmos is a dApp for musicians to create NFTs of their music. These NFTs can then be traded and each time an NFT gets traded, the musician will get 5% of the trade
								as royalty!
							</p>
							<p>It doesn't matter if you're a bathroom singer, growing YouTube/Instagram star, or a famous musician. Anyone can create NFTs of their music!</p>
							<p>
								Musicosmos is a platform to trade individual NFTs of songs. NFTs from artists can be looked at as stocks in the market. Just as buying stocks of companies that people
								believe to perform good in the future can result in massive profits, similarly, the value of these NFTs can skyrocket if that artist grows to be successful over time.
